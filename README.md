EDD Modules
========================

This is a plugin that let's users toggle on and off snippets from the core team maintained repository of code snippets that help modify the default behavior of [Easy Digital Downloads](https://easydigitaldownloads.com).

Snippets are organized into categories (folders) and each snippet is placed in its own file with a name that describes what it does.

## Using Snippets

1. Install this plugin
2. Go to Downloads->Modules and turn the snippet on you want to use

If you need help customising any of the snippets or do not understand how to use them, we recommend [hiring an EDD consultant](https://easydigitaldownloads.com/consultants/).

## Submitting Your Snippet

We welcome and encourage everyone to submit their code snippets. If you would like to submit your snippet, please [fork](https://github.com/easydigitaldownloads/library/fork) the repository and then create a [pull request](https://github.com/easydigitaldownloads/library/compare/).

Please refer to the [Contributing guidelines](https://github.com/easydigitaldownloads/library/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before submitting your pull request.

## Proposing a Snippet

If there is a snippet you are unable to find and would like to propose get written, please open an [issue](https://github.com/easydigitaldownloads/library/issues) and describe your need.

## Notes

This is not a tutorial archive. Please see the [tutorials section](https://easydigitaldownloads.com/docs/section/tutorials/) of the EDD website if you're looking for instructions on how to implement these snippets (and others).

These snippets come with no guarantees. Due to the constant evolution of the EDD codebase, it is possible that the behavior of these snippets may change overtime. Find something broken? [Let us know](https://github.com/easydigitaldownloads/library/issues)!
