EDD Modules:
Note: Not stable yet. This plugin is not finished yet. Still some work to be done here! Don't try to use it.
========================

This is a plugin that let's users toggle on and off modules from the core team maintained repository of code snippets that help modify the default behavior of [Easy Digital Downloads](https://easydigitaldownloads.com).

Modules are organized into categories (folders) and each module is placed in its own file with a name that describes what it does.

## Using Modules

1. Install this plugin
2. Go to Downloads->Modules and turn the module on you want to use

If you need help customising any of the modules or do not understand how to use them, we recommend [hiring an EDD consultant](https://easydigitaldownloads.com/consultants/).

## Submitting Your Module

We welcome and encourage everyone to submit their code modules. If you would like to submit your module, please [fork](https://github.com/easydigitaldownloads/library/fork) the repository and then create a [pull request](https://github.com/easydigitaldownloads/library/compare/).

Please refer to the [Contributing guidelines](https://github.com/easydigitaldownloads/library/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before submitting your pull request.

## Proposing a Module

If there is a module you are unable to find and would like to propose get written, please open an [issue](https://github.com/easydigitaldownloads/library/issues) and describe your need.

## Notes

This is not a tutorial archive. Please see the [tutorials section](https://easydigitaldownloads.com/docs/section/tutorials/) of the EDD website if you're looking for instructions on how to implement these modules (and others).

These modules come with no guarantees. Due to the constant evolution of the EDD codebase, it is possible that the behavior of these modules may change overtime. Find something broken? [Let us know](https://github.com/easydigitaldownloads/library/issues)!
